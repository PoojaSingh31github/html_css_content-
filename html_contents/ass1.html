      Hi, I’m <b>Pooja Singh!</b> 😊 My journey began in the medical field where
      I worked as a <em>lab technician</em> in a blood bank 🧪💉. However, I
      soon realized that I craved more dynamic challenges and new opportunities
      to grow, which led me to transition into the world of technology. Now, I’m
      fully immersed in <b>software development 💻</b>, focusing on Python 🐍,
      backend systems, and artificial intelligence 🤖.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I love most about tech is the constant learning and problem-solving
      it offers. I enjoy taking on complex projects, like building backend
      systems, working with databases, and creating innovative solutions that
      push the boundaries of what’s possible 🚀. I’m also passionate about
      sharing my knowledge with others, whether it's through LinkedIn posts,
      coding tutorials, or collaborating on new projects 👨‍💻.
    </p>
    <p>
      Switching from the medical field to tech has been a rewarding challenge,
      and I’m always eager to learn more and explore how far I can go. Looking
      forward to connecting with others who share the same enthusiasm for
      technology and innovation! 💡✨
